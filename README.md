# Strays of Sparta

This frontend is designed to appeal and catch the eye of an adoption candidate. 
Vibrant colours, heart warming pictures and thoughtful text aim to warm up anyone who is considering saving a stray.
Another selling point of this project is its comprehensive and intuitive architecture, making it easy for the end user to find what (or who) they are looking for.
